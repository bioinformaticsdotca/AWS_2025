### Exercise: Reading text files

Using the commands you just learned, explore the .gff3 file in the Home directory. 

1. Is the file a text file?

<details>
  <summary>
Solution
  </summary>

Yes. You can use `less`, `cat`, `head`, or `tail` and get human-readable info. Note that this doesn't have anything to do with its file extension.
</details> <br>


2. How many lines does the file have?

<details>
  <summary>
Solution
  </summary>


```bash
$ wc -l GCF_009858895.2_ASM985889v3_genomic.gff 
67 GCF_009858895.2_ASM985889v3_genomic.gff
```

There are 67 lines in this file.

</details> <br>

  

3. Can you read the content of the file using less?

<details>
  <summary>
Solution
  </summary>

```bash
$ less GCF_009858895.2_ASM985889v3_genomic.gff 
```

### Exercise: Editing text files

Using the commands you just learned, create a file called helloworld.txt and edit it using nano. 

1. Write “Hello world” into the file. Save the file and exit nano. 
2. Create a subdirectory called “test”; move the helloworld.txt file into test.
3. Create a copy of the helloworld.txt file called helloworld2.txt 

<details>
  <summary>
Solution
  </summary>

1. First, use the `nano` command to open a file called `helloworld.txt`

```bash
$ nano helloworld.txt
```

Inside the nano editor, write "Hello world", then use the `^O` option to write the changes and `^X` to exit.

2. Create a subdirectory called “test”; move the helloworld.txt file into test.

Use the command `mkdir` to create this new directory. Then, use `mv` to move `helloworld.txt` into this directory.


```bash
$ mkdir test
$ mv helloworld.txt test/
```

3. Create a copy of the `helloworld.txt` file called `helloworld2.txt`. 

Change the working directory using `cd`, then use the `cp` command to create the copy.

```bash
$ cd test
$ cp helloworld.txt helloworld2.txt

```

### Reference material
Here are two cheat-sheets that can be useful to have as a reference for common UNIX/Linux commands:

- [FOSSwire.com Unix/Linux Command Reference](https://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf)
- [SUSO.org Unix/Linux Command Syntax and Reference](https://i.redd.it/6s2q64ticje51.png)
