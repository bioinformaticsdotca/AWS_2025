Logging into the Amazon Cloud During the Workshop These instructions will ONLY be relevant in class, as the Cloud will not be accessible from home in advance of the class. On the cloud, we’re going to use the default username: ubuntu Logging in with ssh (Mac/Linux) Make sure the permissions on your private key are secure. Use chmod on your downloaded pem file: chmod 600 CBW.pem To log in to the instance, use the -i command line argument to specify your private key: ssh -i CBW.pem ubuntu@##.uhn-hpc.ca (where ## is your assigned student number.) Logging in with Putty (Windows) Fill in the “Host name” field with ubuntu@##.uhn-hpc.ca (where ## is your assigned student number.) In the left hand categories, in the Connection category next to SSH click on the +. Click on + next to Auth and then click Credentials. In the private-key file for authentication field, hit browse and find the CBW.ppk file that you downloaded. In the left hand categories, click on Session. In the Saved Sessions field write Amazon node and click save. Now that Putty is configured, all you have to do is start putty and double-click on “Amazon node” to login. File System Layout When you log in, you’ll notice that you have two directories: CourseData and workspace. The CourseData directory will contain the files that you’ll need to complete your lab assignments. The workspace directory is where you will work on your labs. Files here will be accessible through your browser. Workspace Everything created in your workspace on the cloud is also available by a web server on your cloud instance. Simply go to the following in your browser: http://##.uhn-hpc.ca/ (where ## is your assigned student number.) RStudio RStudio server is installed on your instance. It is accessible in your browser http://##.uhn-hpc.ca:8080 (where ## is your assigned student number.) The username is ubuntu. We will give you the password in class.

Solution $ ls CourseData R workspace The ls command lists the contents of a working directory. Type the pwd command - what is the output? Solution $ pwd /home/ubuntu The pwd command shows the absolute path to the working directory.

Is the file a text file? Solution Yes. You can use less, cat, head, or tail and get human-readable info. Note that this doesn’t have anything to do with its file extension. How many lines does the file have? Solution $ wc -l GCF_009858895.2_ASM985889v3_genomic.gff 67 GCF_009858895.2_ASM985889v3_genomic.gff There are 67 lines in this file. Can you read the content of the file using less? Solution $ less GCF_009858895.2_ASM985889v3_genomic.gff Exercise: Editing text files Using the commands you just learned, create a file called helloworld.txt and edit it using nano. Write “Hello world” into the file. Save the file and exit nano. Create a subdirectory called “test”; move the helloworld.txt file into test. Create a copy of the helloworld.txt file called helloworld2.txt Solution First, use the nano command to open a file called helloworld.txt $ nano helloworld.txt Inside the nano editor, write “Hello world”, then use the ^O option to write the changes and ^X to exit. Create a subdirectory called “test”; move the helloworld.txt file into test. Use the command mkdir to create this new directory. Then, use mv to move helloworld.txt into this directory. $ mkdir test $ mv helloworld.txt test/ Create a copy of the helloworld.txt file called helloworld2.txt. Change the working directory using cd, then use the cp command to create the copy. $ cd test $ cp helloworld.txt helloworld2.txt Reference material Here are two cheat-sheets that can be useful to have as a reference for common UNIX/Linux commands: FOSSwire.com Unix/Linux Command Reference SUSO.org Unix/Linux Command Syntax and Reference "],["searching-and-sorting-through-files.html", "Searching and sorting through files", " Searching and sorting through files "],["putting-it-all-together.html", "Putting it all together", " Putting it all together "]]
