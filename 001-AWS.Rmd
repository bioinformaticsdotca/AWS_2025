### Logging into the Amazon Cloud During the Workshop  

* These instructions will **ONLY** be relevant in class, as the Cloud will not be accessible from home in advance of the class.
 
* On the cloud, we're going to use the default username: **ubuntu**
 

### Logging in with ssh (Mac/Linux)

* Make sure the permissions on your private key are secure. Use chmod on your downloaded pem file:

```bash
 chmod 600 CBW.pem
```

* To log in to the instance, use the -i command line argument to specify your private key:

```bash
 ssh -i CBW.pem ubuntu@##.uhn-hpc.ca
```

(where ## is your assigned student number.)

### Logging in with OpenSSH client (Windows)

-   Make sure OpenSSH client is installed on your machine. Settings > System > Optional features, then search for "OpenSSH" in your added features.

-   open the "Command Prompt" or "Windows PowerShell" and run

``` bash
 C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe -i CBW.pem ubuntu@##.uhn-hpc.ca
```

## File System Layout

When you log in, you'll notice that you have two directories: **CourseData** and **workspace**.

* The **CourseData** directory will contain the files that you'll need to complete your lab assignments.

* The **workspace** directory is where you will work on your labs. Files here will be accessible through your browser.

## Workspace

* Everything created in your workspace on the cloud is also available by a web server on your cloud instance.  Simply go to the following in your browser:

```
 http://##.uhn-hpc.ca/
```
(where ## is your assigned student number.)

## RStudio 
* RStudio server is installed on your instance. It is accessible in your browser
```
 http://##.uhn-hpc.ca:8080
```
(where ## is your assigned student number.) The username is ***ubuntu***. We will give you the password in class.

## Jupyter Notebook

-   Jupyter Notebook is installed on your instance. It is accessible in your browser

```         
 http://##.uhn-hpc.ca:8000
```

(where \## is your assigned student number.) We will give you the password in class.
